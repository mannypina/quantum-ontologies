							<p><strong>SPACETIME MATTERINGS</strong><p>
					
							<p><em>"Material conditions matter, not because they 'support' particular discourses that are the actual generative factors in the formation of bodies but rather because matter comes to matter through the iterative intra-activity of the world in its becoming."~Karen Barad, "Posthumanist,"" p. 823</em></p>
					
							</p>How you are viewing this text matters. It matters in the sense that technology, whether analog or digital, necessarily mediates experience; and, so, the ways that you are able to interface with the text—and thus, the content of this article itself—hinges on technology. Mobile, desktop, and print-based experiences are each unique material configurations of this text, and each offer a nuanced, but also mutually dependent, enactment of this scholarship. But this text and its various iterations are also a matter of temporality because, as special relativity reminds us, space and time can never really be discussed independently. By this I mean to suggest, in a very literal sense, that the various matterings of this text each do time in unique ways (see, again, special relativity). Space-time matterings are not stable nor singular, but rather emergent and iterative. A brief, and admittedly reductive, example will (hopefully) help begin to elucidate this point.</p>

							<p>Perhaps this text is being displayed on a laptop via a web browser; and, perhaps that laptop is at a coffee shop, people bustling about and music piped gently in overhead. Since the device is connected to the public wifi, various applications are running in the background causing email and news notifications to flash across the top of the screen momentarily interrupting this text. The world closes in here; time accelerates and vast geographic distance is spanned at the rate of 200,000 km/second (depending on the quality of network cable).</p>
		
							<p>Now consider that this text is being displayed on a laptop, but this time it’s in a private study room at the university’s library. The laptop, again, is connected to the internet, but the “do not disturb” function is enabled. The same music from the coffeeshop is playing, but this time it’s delivered through headphones. The global network is still at your fingertips, yet it nevertheless seems somewhat removed, held at arms distance. Time ticks slower here. Now suppose this text isn’t being displayed on a laptop at all, instead it’s coming across on a PDF that’s been printed and is sitting on a dining room table. Perhaps there are a variety of hardcopy articles on similar topics stacked next to this one, a situation seemingly analogous but not substantially equivalent to multiple browser tabs being open on a wifi connected laptop. Here the world spreads out and the flow of time grinds, at least relative to the first scenario presented above.</p>
							<HR>
							<p>It’s not (just) that the technological medium of delivery affects the content. Nor am I suggesting that each of these material configurings fixes the ways in which time and space are experienced. Quite the opposite, in fact. Space-time, as I hope to show in this article, can be, and frequently is, done differently with/in each configuration. In presenting the above example, I want primarily to introduce the idea that time and space are entangled phenomena. That is, space and time do not exist as pre-existing, discrete entities. “Time” Karen Barad (2007) argues, “is not a success of evenly spaced intervals available as a referent for all bodies and space is not a collection of pre-existing points set out as a container for matter to inhabit” (p. 234). Instead, space-times are better conceived of as “differential patterns of mattering (‘diffraction patterns’) produced through complex agential intra-actions of multiple material-discursive practices or apparatuses of bodily production” (p. 140). Space-time is being done—is becoming—in a variety of ways. One of the ways that space-time is frequently enacted, especially with/in digital learning technologies, is in terms of efficiency.</p>
		
							<p>To be sure, efficiency, in and of itself, is not overly problematic. There are many times when efficiency in a space-time configuration (or chronotype) is not only desirable but an ethical imperative. Such instances include the ease and efficiency with which a given technology, like closed captioning, can meet the accessibility needs of users with disabilities (Colton & Holmes, 2018; Horton & Quesenbery, 2013; Zdenek, 2015, 2020). In this case efficiency is more a matter of social justice than speed of use. Efficiency in space-time configurings becomes problematic, however, when it becomes a topos with an internal logical consistency that justifies its own existence, when efficiency is enacted for efficiency’s sake. Take for example, the not-uncommon argument that digital technologies and online course delivery are desirable because they enable the university to reach quickly across geographic distance and thus grant access to a broader global marketplace. Here technological efficiency becomes closely yoked to fiscal success, creating a self-sustaining logic of efficiency (Katz, 1992) that harbors the potential to obscure the very existence of alternative enactments of digital technologies such as the social justice iterations aforementioned.  Or consider that Lauren Salisbury (2018) found that university faculty frequently do not view digital technologies as a part of their pedagogy or as matter of social justice, and, instead are most likely to view technologies as a way to “(a) improve efficiency and (b) make teaching and learning easier for themselves and their students” (p. 11). These technologies, then, become a space-time configuration that privileges time space compression (see Table 1) and is thereby rhetorically dominated by a neoliberal enactment of efficiency.</p>
		
							<p>In this article, I want to posit a way past such a singular space-time enactment of digital learning technologies by arguing for what I term quantum ontologies wherein many value-laden chronotypes can occupy the same techno-material space in a state of superposition. In this article I turn to the quantum as a theoretical framework for understanding the chronotopic consequence of digital technologies in higher education. Thus, my employment of the quantum is less a matter of physics qua physics, and is more accurately described as an overarching “quantum philosophy” that is not only useful for rhetorical studies, but I argue is necessary to apprehend the complexity of technological space-time matterings. Karen Barad (2018) affirms the importance of the quantum, arguing that “Quantum theory, despite tales to the contrary, is not restricted to some alleged mico-realm…Nor does quantum theory live in the realm of rarified ideas that now and again has applications for the real world” (p. 62). Quantum theory, then, bears direct value on issues such as “war, militarism, racism, colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism” (p. 62)</p>
		
							<p>Importantly, a foundational aspect of quantum superposition is that measurement is key to resolving indeterminacy, a point to which I return in more detail later. Meaning that it is only when we actually look for enactments of technologies beyond that of efficiency that we create the possibility for their existence. One of the findings from this research project is that for many instructors in online learning spaces there is a vague sense that digital teaching technologies can indeed be enacted so as to meet social justice needs, but they are unsure, though, of how to bring this about in their online courses. Quantum ontologies, then, offer a way forward for understanding and enacting the chronotropic complexity of digital technologies in ways beyond that of just efficiency. This work is especially important at a time when social justice efforts in higher education are under increasing legislative threat and continue to face roll-backs nationwide.</p>
