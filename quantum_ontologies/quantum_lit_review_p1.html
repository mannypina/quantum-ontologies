							<p><em>“Temporality is produced through the iterative enfoldings of phenomena marking the sedimenting historiality of differential patterns of mattering...Time has a history.” ~Karen Barad, </em>Meeting the Universe Halfway,<em> p. 180. </em></p>
							<hr>
					
							<p>Time has long been a touchstone of both rhetorical theory and practice, even if it has never fully been afforded canonical status within the discipline. As Collin Bjork and Frida Buhre (2021, “Resisting”) note, despite the fact that temporal rhetorics may not be an officially named subfield of research within rhetoric, there is no shortage of scholarship that centers temporal concerns. To name only a few examples, time has been central to investigations of social justice (Bjork &amp; Buhre, “Braiding” 2021; Gomez, 2021), gender studies (Aronson, 1999; Jack, 2007, 2009; McBean, 2015), disability studies (Gallop, 2019; Samuels, 2017), and social responsibility (Vivian, 2014). In fact, such attention has been afforded to time that Doug Downs (2022) has recently called for it to be named threshold concept proper in writing studies. Such a wide disciplinary engagement evinces the fact that the very idea of temporality is rather complex as it has been conceptualized and operationalized in a multiplicity of divergent ways. Therefore, it might do better to conceive of time as multiple—as mutually-informing but nevertheless multiple rhetorical times. In this section, I work to trace some of the larger contours of time/s extant in the field’s scholarship. It is not my intention to provide an exhaustive history of time/s in rhetoric; rather, I want to briefly elucidate three rhetorical frameworks underwriting time/s in rhetoric, namely <em>chronos, kairos,</em> and <em>chronotypes</em>.</p>
		
							<p>As I’ll show, these three frameworks for engaging temporal concerns are not mutually exclusive, independent categories but instead are entangled—weaving deeply in and through each other. I want to elucidate how the very concept of time is itself a “coordinating mechanism” (Mol, 2002, p. 117) that holds together a distributed collective of mutually informing types of time. Thus, through this entangled reading of rhetorical times, one aim in this review of the literature is to locate the temporal with/in the material, to demonstrate how times are not just discursive but also-always ontological. I also want to draw attention toward how various configurations of space-time (otherwise known as  chronotypes) can be productive for understanding value-oriented enactments of digital learning technologies. Finally, I want to push against the concept of multiple ontologies and instead argue for what I call <em>quantum ontologies</em> wherein chronoptic enactments of technologies don’t [necessarily] arise from discrete sites of becoming, but instead exist in a quantum state of superposition. Such a topos allows for many chronotypes to occupy the same techno-material space. This extension of chronotypes is important because it helps demonstrate how digital technologies, especially in online learning environments, can work in service to ethics other than that of expediency.</p>
							
							<p><strong>chronos</strong></p>
							<p>The first framework for understanding time is <em>chronos</em>, or time as broken into discrete, quantifiable, and linear units of measurement. On its surface, such a rendering of time might appear to exist outside the purview of rhetoric, a refrain not unfamiliar in rhetoric. For instance, Michelle Ballif (1992) argues—rightly—that the reclamation of women’s histories hinges, in part, from time being “experienced <em>kairotically</em> not chronologically” (96). Here, Ballif seems to downplay the rhetorical aspects of time-as-chronology. However, as John Gallagaher (2021), counters (also rightly), more overtly rhetorical forms of time, such as <em>kairos</em>, are only possible because of the organizational structures provided by chronological time. Echoing theorists such as Philip Sipiora (2002) and John Smith (1969), Gallagher contends that "<em>chronos</em> frames and circumscribes <em>kairos</em>" (p. 533), thereby more closely relating these two temporal frameworks and, in the process, highlighting the distinctly rhetorical consequence of chronos. Further, I would argue that it is rather reductive to characterize chronos in such descriptive, a-rhetorical terms as “mere chronology” might suggest on its surface. The very conceptualization of clock time after all, involves the imposition of a linear organization of events which, in turn, implies at least some level of rhetoricity, however subtle and naturalized.</p>
							
							<p><strong>kairos</strong></p>
					
							<p>More frequently than <em>chronos</em>, time has also been framed in more overtly rhetorical terms via the Aristotelian notion of <em>kairos</em>, or the importance of timeliness for persuasive discourse. If chronos represents time as quantitative, kairos introduces a qualitative and more distinctly rhetorical perspective of time. This is not to suggest, though, that kairos, as just one iteration of time, can itself even be limited to just opportune timing and appropriate measure. On the contrary, following James Kinneavy and Catherine Eskin’s (2000) call to consider a more expansive definition of kairos, this temporal framework has experienced rich, multidimensional engagement across the field including its theorization as mindfulness (Peary, 2016), a rhetoric of revelation or divine time (Crosby, 2009), ambient dwelling (Rickert, 2004, 2013), and as a <em>spatio</em>-temporal analytic tool for image events (Stephenson, 2009). This is to say, then, that much like chronos, kairos too exists as an entangled multiplicity of time/s in and of itself; to say nothing, again, about the ways in which it is always-already entangled with chronos.</p>
							<p>An important aspect of kairos as a rhetorical framework is that it is not limited to (just) the discursive but is also inclusive of material concerns. While many rhetorical theorists have engaged <em>kairos</em> as a matter of (also) matter, arguably none have been as forceful or thorough as Thomas Rickert in mattering time, particularly in his pivotal work <em>Ambient Rhetoric</em>. Importantly, for Rickert, an acknowledgement that kairos and place are enmeshed is not a novel or even recent advancement in the field. For both ancient and contemporary rhetorical theorists, Rickert argues that,</p>
					
							<p><blockquote>“...kairos itself, as something ontological, is inseparable from new forms of becoming, new forms of disclosure. The kairos of a situation is a moment placed not as something between a subject and exterior situation but as mutually involved and evolving vectors of material and discursive force….[p]lace on this account is not a neutral, material stage for the emergence of a kairotic situation but itself a complex of relations vitally enmeshed in what comes forth to take place as kairos” (p. 90).</blockquote></p>
				
							<p>The place-based, situatedness of time is not meant to contradict the more traditional discursive approaches to understanding kairos; rather, it extends them by recognizing that some discursive possibilities are foreclosed and others created precisely <em>because</em> of the material affordances of time-as-emplaced. To invoke time as rhetorical, then, is likewise to invoke place. That is, the environment, to include the material as well as the temporal, is merely not a backdrop for rhetorical action but is itself agential. This coupling of matter to time is largely commonplace in lay terms: we never ask someone to meet us at a certain time without also specifying where to meet. But the entangling of temporality and materiality is significant for rhetorical theory because it opens up the possibility for time to be both enacted and experienced differently in relation to material (and, as I’ll also argue, technological) configurations; which is to say that time can be read as <em>chronotopic</em>.</p>
