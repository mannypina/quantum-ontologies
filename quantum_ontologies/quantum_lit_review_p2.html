							<p><strong>chronotypes</strong></p>
							<p>While I hesitate to assign a singular starting point for theorizing chronotypes, perhaps the most relevant place to begin is with Mikael Bakhtin’s <em>The Dialogic Imagination</em> (1981). For Bakhtin, a chronotype refers to the “intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships expressed in literature” (p. 84). As in Einstein’s theory of special relativity, the chronotype, as it manifests in literature, fuses time and space inseparably together. “Time, as it were'' Bakhtin writes, “thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to movements of time, plot and history” (p. 84). Bakhtin used this entangling of time and space (or, spacetime) to demonstrate how there existed many different forms of time-space configurings in literature, such as <em>adventure time, folkloric time</em>, and <em>idyllic time</em>. Spacetime, again following special relativity, is not a fixed absolute but rather is iterative and emergent. Even though Bakhtin employed the concept of chronotypes as a way to theorize literature, he did not preclude the possibility of its utility beyond the novel, especially since the very idea of chronotypes were derived from Einsteinian mathematics and had enjoyed application elsewhere in the natural sciences (Bemong &amp; Borghart, 2008). In other words, as a model for understanding the consequence of spacetime configurings, chronotypes are not just restricted to literature nor, importantly, are they simply an abstraction or literary device. Chronotypes were derived from and remain grounded in “the real;” and even more explicitly than <em>kairos</em>, chronotypes draw tightly together the emergent relationships between temporality and materiality.</p>
		
							<p>In composition-rhetoric, the concept of the chronotype has not necessarily been an area of intense disciplinary focus, but it has been employed as a framework for analyzing the relationships between: genre and power (Schryer, 1999), writers’ process and literate activity (Prior &amp; Shipka, 2003), argumentation and deliberative rhetorics (Jack, 2006), and subject-matter expertise and ontologies (Jack, 2022). Of these unquestionably important figures, Jordynn Jack stands apart given her sustained and extensive efforts to draw disciplinary attention to the rhetorical consequence of spacetime configurations. In what follows, I both draw upon and work to extend Jack’s theorization of chronotypes by arguing for the ethical valuations that accompany various spacetimes configurations, particularly those enacted in digital learning spaces. Put differently, I want to suggest that chronotypes are a matter of, per Karen Barad (2007), <em>ethico-onto-epistem-ology</em>, which denotes “an appreciation of the intertwining of ethics, knowing, and being” (p. 185). Furthermore, I want to push against the notion of multiple, competing (ethico)onoloties and instead argue for understanding chronotypes as existing in a quantum state of superposition wherein many different ethical  valuations, often contradictory, exist simultaneously in the same chronotopic spacetime configuring. </p>
							
							<p>Jack (2007) initially attended to chronotypes in largely representational terms, as “a way to understand not only how such [ideological] arguments depend on specific configurations of space and time, but also the implications of those space-time configurations for argument and decision making” (p. 52-53). More specifically, Jack uses the concept of chronotypes to analyze the ideological underpinnings of policy arguments associated with genetically modified foods (GMFs). In total, Jack identified four distinct chronotypes related to GMFs (See Table 1). While Jack’s work in “Chronotypes” is foundational for many reasons, I want to draw attention to two insights of particular importance. First, chronotypes not only create meaning, but they also are performative in that they coordinate action. “The relationship between space and time,” Jack argues, “is always <em>value-oriented</em>, reflecting societal assumptions about the place of human individuals in space and time and the type of action allowed within that space and time” (p. 67). Thus, chronotypes are more deliberative than they are descriptive.</p>
							
							<p>Second, Jack’s early work positions the technological as also material. GMFs, for Jack, are both a material thing <em>and</em> a technology. This point is key because technology, especially digital technology, is frequently read in non-material ways. For example, digital learning management systems (LMSs) are typically positioned as inert vessels through which instruction passes—as <em>non-places</em> that lack, or at best inhibit, relationships (Rice, 2012, p. 8). That is, the technological interface is often designed so as to obfuscate its presence—we are not supposed to notice the work of the interface, it is only when a “glitch” occurs that “disrupt[s] the seamlessness and intuitiveness of our electronic environments” (Boyle, 2018, p. 116) that the interface becomes perceptible or rises to the level of consciousness. Importantly, this implies that the technological is more than a backdrop for rhetoric work (Boyle et. al, 2018, p. 256). The technological is material is rhetorically consequential. Angela Haas (2012) argues just this point when she defines technology as a techné, “not as transparent things but as cultural artifacts imbued with histories and values that shape the ways in which people see themselves and others in relation to technology”(p. 288). Digital technologies, such as LMSs or GMFs, then, are not virtual spaces through which information passes devoid of relationship, they are highly consequential techno-material places—places with spacetime configurations that have the potential to control and coordinate users’ values and actions therein.</p>
					
							<p><strong>re/turning to chronotypes</strong></p>
					
							<p>Jack (2022) re/turned <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="To re/turn to something is not (necessarily) to go back to an already-established past; instead to re/turn is to “turn it over again and again—iteratively intra-acting, re-diffracting, diffracting anew, in the making of new temporalities” (Barad, “Diffracting” 168).">[1]</a> to chronotypes as a means for examining the relationship between subject matter expertise and water ontologies (See Table 2). This further exploration of chronotypes again drew on a public policy debate (this time over water rights) but was decidedly less interested in the discursive forms of rhetorical argument possible in a given spacetime configuration. Instead, Jack worked to tie ethos (expressed as expertise) to materiality vis-à-vis the chronotype. She argued clearly that “we can understand these different enactments of water not simply as discursive frames that all represent the same thing but as ontologies arising from diverse enactments of water present in different communities and institutions'' (p. 328, emphasis added). Yes, chronotypes are discursive; but they are also deeply ontological—entangled with and in matter.</p>
				
							<p>Toward this end, Jack offered three different chronotopic enactments of “water-as”, each with a unique spatiotemporal relationship that authorizes unique types of expertise. The naming of multiple (and, per Jack, competing) ontologies represents a crucial advancement in theorizing the rhetorical import of chronotypes (See Table 2). In Jack’s initial work, again, chronotypes remained largely abstractions, discursive frameworks that dis/allowed certain arguments in relation to a given technology. As a rhetorical actant, therefore, GMFs were relatively stable and singular—it was the argument itself that took on different spatiotemporal characteristics. Conversely, as an ontology, <em>water itself</em>, not the arguments it authorizes, is an iterative and emergent rhetorical agent. What’s more, similar to the aforementioned concept of times as multiple, water ontologies too emerge as chronotropically multiple: water located in a lab (water-as-chemical-entity) is not the same water that is located in a private well (water-as-resource).</p>
					
							<p>Importantly, for Jack, chronotypes are indeed multiple and simultaneous, but they arise from discrete space-time configurings <a href="#note2" id="ref2" title="This reasoning closely follows Annemarie Mol’s (2002) understanding of atherosclerosis as being distributed across discrete sites of becoming. For Mol, each enactment of the disease has “a site of its own” (p. 115).">[2]</a>. For example, the water-as-lifeblood ontology could not result from a space-time configuring wherein water is located in a lab. According to multiple ontologies, it is the limited space-time of the laboratory itself that allows water to be enacted as water-as-chemical-entity; conversely it is the deep time scale and a broad ecosystem that enables the performance of water-as-lifeblood. And as multiple, these two ontologies could not occupy the same topological space and therefore necessarily exist, at least partially, in contradistinction to one another. This is not to say, however, that these ontologies are wholly separate; they are not. As Annemarie Mol (1999) has argued, “what ‘multiplicity’ entails instead is that, while realities may clash at some points, elsewhere the various performances of an object may <em>collaborate</em> and even <em>depend on</em> one another” (p. 83). It might therefore be more accurate to say that chronotypes can be enacted as a mutually inclusive single-multiple—as “more than one but less than many” (Law, 1999, p. 10). But despite this hanging-together of chronotopic ontologies, we are still confronted with the problem that multiple enactments of chronotypes remain separate enough such that they are unable to simultaneously occupy the same space-time locality. The time-space configuring seems to limit and fix what chronotypes may arise from it.</p>
					
							<p><strong>toward the quantum</strong></p>
					
							<p>But in technologically mediated space-times, quite often multiple chronotypes frequently do inhabit the same material configuring—a contradiction that multiple ontologies seemingly cannot resolve. Learning technologies, like LMSs or Zoom, can simultaneously be enacted as a matter of efficiency <em>and</em> social justice in the same space-time configuration. What I am proposing, therefore, is a model of quantum ontologies that builds on Jack’s theorization of chronotypes and is better able to account for a variety of value-oriented chronotopic enactments existing within the same material configuring. Whereas Annemarie Mol (2002) argued for flow <em>between</em> sites of becoming, I posit the existence of flow <em>within</em> a site. Such a re-rendering of chronotypes is important because technological spaces are frequently underwritten by what Stephen Katz (1992) has previously termed an ethic of expediency wherein efficiency-for-efficiency’s sake becomes the driving ethical force, and so “subsume all other ethics under it, making all ethics expedients and thus replacing them” (p. 270). However, even though quantum ontologies creates the potential for enactments of digital technology beyond that of efficiency, it is vitally important to note that the realization of such enactments hinges on their ability to be accounted for. What is needed, then, is what Barad (2005) terms a <em>politics of possibilities</em>: “ways of responsibly imagining and intervening in the configurations of power, that is, intra-actively configuring spacetimematter” (p. 246). I explore these concepts in more detail in the discussion section of this research study: quantum ontologies &amp; digital technologies.</p>
