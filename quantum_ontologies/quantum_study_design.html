							<p><strong>institutional context</strong></p>
							<p>This research project utilized an IRB-approved, qualitative research design that worked to gather data at multiple levels. More specifically, the methodological frameworks for this study was informed by a set of interrelated questions:</p>
					
							<ul>
								<li>What value-oriented enactments of digital technologies do instructors employ in their online courses; and</li>
								<li>what are the [potential] material-temporal consequences of such enactments?</li>
							</ul>	
		
							<p>Since this research project specifically aimed to understand instructional valuations and enactments of digital learning technologies, as opposed to student or administrative, the target population for participants were instructors who were assigned to teach at least one course designated as either fully online or hybrid course delivery. Data was gathered at a regional, public institution designed as an R2 Doctoral University, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), and Minority Serving Institution (MSI) during the fall of 2022. In total, 29 instructors completed the online survey, and 23 agreed to the follow-up interview. Participants for this study represented a broad range of disciplinary affiliation and included faculty from all five different colleges across the university: Liberal Arts (which were the majority of participants), Science, Business, Nursing and Health Science, and Education and Human Development <a href="#note1" id="ref1" title="This does not suggest that the data gathered during this investigation should be interpreted as representative of all faculty experiences in the respective colleges. Nor is it my intent here to claim that this research project speaks for the institution as a whole at the site of data collection. Rather, as I indicate later in this article, what the inclusion of perspectives from across a wide variety of disciplinary perspectives points toward is the potential for multiple ontologies to exist in a quantum, rather than competing, state of superposition.">[1]</a>.</p>
					
							<p><strong>data collection</strong></p>
							<p>Eligible participants were first invited to complete a digital survey that included four, open- ended questions related to their instructional valuations of online learning technologies (see Appendix A). Then, upon completion of the survey, participants were asked to participate in an optional follow-up interview (also conducted digitally) that would allow them to expand on and provide added depth to their initial survey responses. The follow-up interviews employed a phenomenological approach (Bevan, 2014) that used participants' initial responses as springboards for structuring the interview. Participants were prompted to <em>contextualize, apprehend</em>, and finally <em>clarify</em> their initial survey responses. Importantly, this method of interviewing “enables a researcher to examine a person’s experience both actively and methodically” and “provides a sound basis for interpreting experience grounded in the origin of the material” (Bevan, 2014, pp. 138- 143). These multiple avenues for data collection allowed for the elicitation of multi-point, rich descriptions of participants’ enactments and valuations of digital learning technologies.</p>
					
							<p><strong>data analysis</strong></p>
							
							<p>Data analysis was an iterative process that included multiple rounds of coding that began in media res of data collection activities. Initial survey responses were coded openly and inductively for starter codes which provided the structure for subsequent interviews (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008). For example, when asked what they valued <em>most</em> about online learning technologies, one participant’s survey response stated that they value Blackboard for “the flexibility [and] removal of temporal and spatial barriers to education and communication. I love interacting with students when they need it.” This response was assigned two initial codes. First, it was assigned a space-time configuration of <em>Blackboard</em>, and it was coded as <em>flexibility</em> since this work was extant in the participant’s response. In the follow up interview the participant was asked, following a phenomenological approach to interviewing, to contextualize and clarify this valuation of digital technology <a href="#note1" id="ref2" title="An example of an interview question that was asked in response to this survey response is: “In the initial survey you indicated that one of the things that you value most about digital teaching technologies is the flexibility they provide you and students. Can you tell me more about what you mean by ‘flexibility’ and why it’s valuable for your online instruction?”">[2]</a>.</p>
					
							<p>A second round of coding took place following the completion of data collection wherein initial codes were cross-checked against participants’ contextualization and clarification data. This led to the creation of more precise and granular codes. For instance, based on participants’ contextualization, the initial code of <em>flexibility</em> was able to be further distilled in three distinct ways: policy flexibility, personal flexibility, and technical flexibility. Categories of shared meaning and experience across space-time configurings were established during this portion of data analysis. For example, multiple technologies, including Zoom and Blackboard, were identified as having a shared valuation of <em>personal flexibility</em> because through Zoom students were able to receive instruction while being geographically remote from campus and through Blackboard, students were able to access course content across a broad range of times.</p>
					
							<p>During the third and final round of coding, categories of experience were read against Jordynn Jack’s (2022) most recent conceptualization of chronotypes as ontological (p. 328). The granular codes established in the second round of data analysis were coded up into shared, value-laden space-time enactments of digital technologies. A chronotopic rendering of instructors’ valuations draws together the temporal and ontological consequence of various enactments of digital learning technologies. Chronotopic valuations of digital learning technologies are instructive for understanding how these technologies diffract, often in contradictory ways.</p>
					
							<p>As I explain in more detail in the discussion section, this portion of the data analysis revealed that many chronotypes were being enacted within a given space-time configuration. To briefly illustrate, data analysis showed that instructors see  Blackboard as a space-time configuration that is highly flexible in that it elides the temporal and geographic constraints that normally accompany instruction. At the same time, though, Blackboard also enacts a chronotype that is likewise frustratingly rigid, locking instruction into a narrow (and often inaccessible) material interface. Flexibility and rigidity are value-laden chronotypes that need not be seen as existing in competition or even opposition to each other; instead, I argue that they are better understood as existing in a quantum state of superposition. This, in turn, opens the possibility for enacting these technologies in more democratic ways beyond that of an ethic of efficiency. In the discussion section, I turn toward more fully theorizing quantum ontologies and their significance as the use of digital technologies continue to permeate across the landscape of higher education.</p>
